title: Keeping up with Data Science Research after Leaving Academia
---

One of the transitions I found the most difficult after graduate school was keeping up with the newest research without the culture of academia. When you're in school, you're surrounded by professors and graduate students whose main jobs are in researching new ideas and reading others' research. When you enter the workforce, you have to additionally focus on deadlines, clients, and the day-to-day work of an office. You may also find that the people around you, especially those who are less technical, are not talking about research so it's harder to absorb new ideas passively like you can while in university. 

It may seem daunting at first to keep up with the massive amount of new research being published in the field every day, just by having a good set of resources and setting aside a few hours a week, you can keep abreast of a lot of new research in the field. Here's a list of the resources I use to keep abreast of new research in data science to avoid getting left behind by the fast-moving field. Obviously, this isn't exhaustive, but hopefully it'll give you a good start to explore new research in data science.

## Conference Talks

One of the best ways to keep up with new research is to attend conferences. But of course, conferences are expensive and time-consuming, and you may not have the ability to go to all the conferences you would like. There's a wealth of conference talks on youtube, but searching for your favorite researchers or data science topics go a long way in narrowing down the talks that would be interesting.

Some good conferences to start out with are [KDD](http://www.kdd.org/), [IEEE International Conference on Data Mining](http://icdm2018.org/), and [AI by the Bay](https://ai.bythebay.io/). The former two are more academic conferences where you can learn about more theoretical research of data science, whereas the latter is focused on applied data science in a startup context where you can see those theories applied to real-world problems (often with code and data). 

## Mailing Lists

There are a few mailing lists that I find particularly helpful for sending you weekly or monthly updates on what is happening in data science, without having to scour the internet for interesting papers or blogs.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/data_elixir.png)
- [Data Elixir](https://dataelixir.com/)

Data Elixir is a weekly data science news e-mail list. Although it's a little light on research papers, Data Elixir has a great selection of good tutorials, blog posts, and less-technical news articles sent to your inbox. I think this email list particularly shines with visualization tutorials, which are sometimes forgotten in other email lists.

<br />

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ds_roundup.png) 
- [Data Science Roundup](http://roundup.fishtownanalytics.com/)

Another good mailing list is Data Science Roundup, which like Data Elixir will show up in your inbox weekly. Sponsored by Fishtown Analytics, the articles sent by Data Science Roundup include company technical data science blogs, tutorials, and some general interest less-technical articles.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/kd_nuggets.png) 
- [KD Nuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/news/subscribe.html)

KD Nuggets is a classic. The yellow and black color scheme and general 1990s feel to the site shouldn't deter you from subscribing to this email list. It contains conferences, papers, opinions, interviews, etc. - everything you need from a mailing list. If you're going to subscribe to just one of these mailing lists, this should be the one.
<br />

## Blogs

Blogs are another good resource, mostly for tutorials and technical deep-dives into new or innovative models. There are a _ton_ of blogs out there, but I'll just list a few of my favorites.
 
- [Unofficial Google Data Science Blog](http://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com/)

On the Unofficial Google Data Science Blog, interesting papers are published from data scientists and machine learning engineers from across Google that may be of interest to a applied data science audience. 
<br />
<br />
- [Spotify's Tech Blog](https://labs.spotify.com/)

Written by employees of the company, Spotify has some of the most interesting data science problems to solve. Spotify's tech blog covers some of these interesting problems and their innovative solutions to those problems.
<br />
<br />
- [Stitchfix Blog](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/)

Stitchfix has a fantastic data science and engineering team, and their corporate blogs are often very technical, while still being approachable and creative. Stitchfix also promotes their employees' talks at conferences on their blog, so be sure to check some of those out as well!
<br />
<br />
- [Domino Data Lab Blog](https://blog.dominodatalab.com/)

Domino Data Lab is another corporate blog, but it also features presentations at Domino meetups from people outside the company, including data scientists at top tech companies like Google and Uber, small startups, and universities.
<br />
<br />
- [UChicago's Data Science for Social Good Blog](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/blog/)

The University of Chicago's Data Science for Social Good blog hosts a number of articles around real-world data science projects that affect social change. This is a great blog if you're interested 
<br />
<br />
- Subscribe to [Medium](https://medium.com/)

Medium is great because it has a built-in recommendation system. Just put that your interests include machine learning and data science when you sign up, and they'll automatically email you articles relevant to those interests to your inbox every week or so. Furthermore, if you find an article you like, you can also read that author's other articles on their individual blog.
