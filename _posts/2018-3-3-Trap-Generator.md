title: Deep Learning Trap Lyric Generator, or, How Trap Music is not as Formulaic as Music Critics Think
---

*2 Chainz's Pink Trap House in Atlanta, GA*

If you’re not interested in getting into the technical details of this project and just want to play around with generating your own trap lyrics, you can use the web app I created [here](http://trap-generator.zeager.xyz).

*Warning: This post will have some foul language (just the nature of the data)*

**Intro to the Trap Music Genre**
------

Trap music is a sub genre of hip hop, which emerged in the early aughts with Atlanta-based rappers like Young Jeezy and Gucci Mane and now includes rappers like Lil Yachty and Migos. Its subject matter often descries the cycle of poverty and the ‘trap’ (a place where drugs are dealt). In addition to the subject matter of the lyrics, trap music also has common lyrical and beat characteristics throughout the genre, which has given it the reputation for being repetitive and formulaic amongst music critics and fans:

> the formula [for trap] has become almost comically predictable: Open with an ambient intro that encompasses the song’s main theme, build the groove with some vocal booth ad-libs and producer drops, then open up with the beat track. Now, throw in a  handful of “uuhhs!”s and “whats!” and dive into your first verse. Producers seem perfectly content to allow this sound to proliferate as is — but what’s keeping this repetitive formula from getting old?

*[Source](https://flypaper.soundfly.com/produce/why-does-trap-music-keep-working/)*

For example, here's an actual popular trap song -- Versace by Migos:

*Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace/
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace/
Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'Luminati*

So I sought out to see: if trap music is *really* so easy to produce, could a computer write convincing trap lyrics?

**The Problem**
------

In this text generation problem, I am essentially trying to predict the next word given a sequence of words, although character-level models have been shown to be very effective in text generation as well.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/trap_images/1.png)

So in this case, we’d like to feed in the input sequence ‘The quick brown foxed jumped over the’ and try to predict the last word in the sentence. If we move this input sequence window to the right by one word, the input would be “quick brown fox jumped over the lazy” and then it would attempt to predict the next word in the sequence (dog, in this case).
 
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/trap_images/2.png)

By moving this window of input sequences as we predict more words, the model can generate an entire text based on the data it was trained on.

**The Data**
------

The first thing you need to train such a model is a large database of sequences like the ones above to train on. There’s no common database for trap lyrics, so for this model I created a simple web scraper to scrape lyrics from AZLyrics for a selection of hand-selected trap artists. I scraped the entire discography of 31 atists for this project. These were further broken down into five word sequences (the input sequence), with a corresponding output word, which created about 500,000 unique training examples. 

**Explaining the Model**
------

**Word2Vec**

The model is trying to predict one word out of the 34,000 unique words in the training data, but if you one-hot encode the data, it has no context into how words relate to one another and the definition of words. Let’s take the previous sentence as an example: the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. If fox was replaced by a very similar word, like foxes, the model would treat that word as an entirely different word. This would make training a text generation model extremely difficult. 

Instead, I used skip-gram Word2Vec to as the input to the model, which produces word embeddings rather than a simple one-hot encoding for words. Word2Vec is a model that creates word embeddings by finding similar words based on them showing up in common contexts. 
From these, we now have contextualized output for each word that can find different verb tenses and synonyms. 

For this model, because the training data is so specific, I chose to train my own Word2Vec model on trap lyrics using a package called gensim, rather than relying on pre-trained Word2Vec models trained on more formal corpuses like news articles. 

{% highlight python %}

list_lyrics = pickle.load(open('clean_list_lyrics.p','rb'))

#Word2Vec Embedding
len(list_lyrics) #4584 songs

max_seq_length = 10

#create lines/sentences

sequences=[]

for lyric in list_lyrics:
    #add spaces around all new line characters
    lyric = re.sub(r'\n([a-zA-Z])',r'\n \1',lyric)
    lyric = re.sub(r'([a-zA-Z])\n',r'\1 \n',lyric)
    #deal with multiple new line characters, but keeping single \n
    lyric = re.sub(r'\n{2,}','\n',lyric)
    #remove return characters
    lyric = re.sub('\r',' ',lyric)
    #split into words
    words = lyric.split(' ')
    #split into sequences
    lines = [words[i:i+max_seq_length] for i in range(0,len(words), max_seq_length)]
    sequences.append(lines)
 
#now we have a list of each song, with a list containing
#the words in the song, split by sequence seq_length

w2vmodel = Word2Vec(lines,min_count=1,iter=200)

{% endhighlight %}

**Plain “Vanilla” Neural Network**
------

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/trap_images/3.png)

Neural networks have become some of the best models for more complex problems in machine learning because of the hidden layers, which allows the model to create a more complex set of features (weights) from the input layer through a process called backpropagation. I’m not going to go into too much detail here about exactly how neural networks work, since there’s a good amount of online resources available online (try Andrew Ng’s Deep Learning Coursera specialization, for example).

The problem with the simple, feed-forward vanilla neural network shown above for text generation is that they don’t take into account features learned over different parts of the input text, which is important for something sequential like text.

**Recurrent Neural Network**
------
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/trap_images/4.png)

Recurrent neural networks (RNN) try to solve the problem of learning over time that is present in a vanilla neural network. In a nutshell, the recurrent neural network takes information from the prior time steps and the current time step, where the feed-forward neural network can only take information from the current timestep. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/trap_images/5.png)

A recurrent neural network does this by essentially stacking the hidden layers, so that the input to the activation function (A in the below graph) includes the input from the current time step *and* the previous timestep. 

This very quickly runs into the vanishing gradient problem, and because of this, the model becomes unable to learn over many time steps. Furthermore, it has no mechanism for determining whether or not the information is important.

**Long Short Term Memory Networks**
------

When you are trying to create cohesive lyrics, you need to remember things like the chorus, that may have happened several sequences before the current sequence. A simple RNN has no capability of learning what pieces of information are important, so it would not know that a chorus is important and would need to be remembered so that it could be repeated after a verse.

This is where a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network comes in to place. LSTM models are an extension of Recurrent Neural Networks developed by [Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997)](http://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf) that include the ability to determine what is important to remember. This is done through two additional trainable layers: *forget gates* and *input gates*.

*Forget Gates*

Forget gates allow the model to ‘forget’ the hidden state from the previous time step. Much like how you dump most of the information from you memory moments after the final exam, this forget gate essentially allows the model to learn what is important and what isn’t important to remember. 

*Input Gates*

Input gates allow the LSTM model to decide whether or not to update the current hidden state using the data from the previous state. This is a gate that prevents unnecessary information to have an impact on the output for the current time step. This is sort of analogous to hearing a professor say “this won’t be on the next exam, but it may be on the final,” and you  immediately stop using learning any of the information for the current test (which in this case would be the current time step), but you keep it in your notebook in case it’s important for the final exam (which could be any future time step).

All of these gates are trainable weights, just like the weights of the hidden layers of a neural network.

If you want to learn about RNN/LSTM networks and how they work, I can’t recommend Andrej Karpathy’s [post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) on the effectiveness of RNN's enough.

**Code**
------

Because I wanted to use a Word2Vec embedding for the words, we have to first create a mapping from the word to the corresponding index from the word to vector model. The following functions load the word2vec mode and translate between the word2vec embedding index and the word itself.

*Word2Vec-related Functions*

{% highlight python %}

def load_w2v_model():
    #load word 2 vec model
    w2vmodel = Word2Vec.load('word2vec_model')

    w2v_weights = w2vmodel.wv.syn0

    #prepare data for training
    vocab_size, embedding_size = w2v_weights.shape

    return w2vmodel, w2v_weights

def word_to_ix(word,w2vmodel):
    return w2vmodel.wv.vocab[word].index

def ix_to_word(ix,w2vmodel):
    return w2vmodel.wv.index2word[ix]
    
{% endhighlight %}
   
I already prepared the input data into a list of lists, with each sublist containing up to 6 words each. Because the model expects 6 words as input, the data must be padded if the line is less than 6 words long. The following code pads this data with the word2vec index for my catch-all ____UNSEEN____ variable. This will allow the model to (hopefully) learn to ignore words that weren’t in the training index or the word paddings.

*Training/Testing Data Creation and Formatting*

{% highlight python %}

def create_training_data(w2vmodel):
    #import lyrics
    lyrics_train=pickle.load(open('lines_train_'+str(max_seq_length)+'.p','rb'))
    lyrics_test=pickle.load(open('lines_test_'+str(max_seq_length)+'.p','rb'))
    #createtraining Data
    X_train=[]
    y_train=[]
    for line in lyrics_train:
        X_train.append([word_to_ix(word,w2vmodel) for word in line[:-1] if word!=''])
        y_train.append(word_to_ix(line[-1],w2vmodel))

    #create testing data
    X_test=[]
    y_test=[]
    for line in lyrics_test:
        X_test.append([word_to_ix(word,w2vmodel) for word in line[:-1] if word!=''])
        y_test.append(word_to_ix(line[-1],w2vmodel))

    #pad training and testing X data with the unseen word2vec (hopefully the model will learn this is useless)
    X_train=sequence.pad_sequences(X_train, maxlen=max_seq_length, value=word_to_ix('_UNSEEN_',w2vmodel))
    X_test=sequence.pad_sequences(X_test, maxlen=max_seq_length, value=word_to_ix('_UNSEEN_',w2vmodel))

    return X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test
    
{% endhighlight %}

*Keras Deep Learning Model Architecture*

The code below creates the framework of the deep learning model that will be trained using our training sequences we created above. It took a lot of tuning to determine the best model in terms of the lyrics the model was outputting and validation set loss, and I eventually stopped tuning when it became prohibitively expensive on a AWS GPU instance.

In the code below, the embedding layer utilizes the word2vec embedding to convert the words into vectors as the input to the rest of the LSTM model.

The LSTM layers are, just as they sound, the LSTM layers to the model.  Too many layers became extremely difficult (and expensive on an AWS EC2 GPU instance) to train, so I ended up limiting the number of hidden layers to two. The layer size was the largest of the values I tried at 512 nodes. Although it took longer to train the larger layers, they seemed to understand more of the nuances of the trap lyrics, rather than simply outputting the most common curse words from the data. In some of my smaller layer sizes, it was pretty common to see a chorus that was just a string of curse words in a loop.The `return_sequences=True` statement just returns the sequences as input into the next layer of the model. 

The dropout layer randomly selects nodes to drop out, in order to reduce overfitting to the training set. Because the dataset proved difficult to learn for the model, dropout was limited to only .1 after various testing. 
The final layer is a softmax output layer. This outputs a probability, for each word in our vocabulary, of what our next word is.

{% highlight python %}

def lstm_model(num_layers, dropout, layer_size, w2v_weights, max_seq_length):
    vocab_size, embedding_size = w2v_weights.shape
    ## create model
    optimizer=optimizers.Adam()
    model=Sequential()
    model.add(Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_size, input_length=max_seq_length,weights=[w2v_weights],trainable=False))
    for layer in range(num_layers-1):
        model.add(LSTM(layer_size, return_sequences=True))
        model.add(Dropout(dropout))
    model.add(LSTM(layer_size))
    model.add(Dropout(dropout))
    model.add(Dense(vocab_size, activation = 'softmax'))
    model.compile(loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy", optimizer=optimizer, metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model
    
{% endhighlight %}

*Temperature*

Temperature of a softmax output allows you to play with how confident you want the RNN to be in its output. If you reduce the temperature near 0, the model will be very confident in its output, but you also are more likely to run into infinite loops. On the otherhand, if you increase the temperature close to 1, it will be less conservative in its predictions and will likely have more interesting and diverse text at the expense of errors (e.g. in part of speech, etc.).

For example, here's the output with a temperature of 1:
*shawty sucked a star* 
*so she got the hood with me like a man they going hard to find me the shit to like* 
*she fucked me up like a egg*
*my dope and my girl like a dope boy* 

It gets a variety of things wrong, like the phrase *a egg* instead of *an egg*, but personally I think the metaphors in the examples with higher temperature are much more hilarious than with a lower temperature (my dope and my girl like a dope boy).

With a temperature of 0.2:
*im just a young rapper and the other my world god damn god*
 *my baby in the club in my jacuzzi*
 *savage it like i can get a brick on a new whip*
 *young nigga in the club* 
 *fuck the bitch bitch fuck bitch*
 
 It gets much more of the cadence and grammar right, but sort of resorts to a loop of curse words at the end.

def sample(a, temp=1.0):
    try:
        a = np.log(a) / temp
        a = np.exp(a) / np.sum(np.exp(a))
        return np.argmax(np.random.multinomial(1, a, 1))
    except:
        #print('Temperature cannot be 0. Temperature set to 1.')
        return np.argmax(a)
{% endhighlight %}

*Text Generation*

Okay, now for the fun part. The actual *text generation* of this LSTM text generation model. To get a qualitative sense of how well the model would be able to output lyrics, I wanted to output the lyrics every 5th epoch while training, so I used this  `on_epoch_end` function as a callback in my keras model training step. I vary the temperature for four different outputs for each 5th epoch, just to get a sense of the variety of lyrics it will produce given various temperatures. Basically, we take a seed text, clean it, convert it to our sequence format with padding just like we do the training data, and input it into the model, predicting the next word and adding the predicted word to the input to predict the following word, and so on until we get the full predicted text.

**Results**
------

Here are a few of my favorite lines that were generated using this model:

*killer girls in my rental/
lookin like me/
eyepatch irwing on the double six/ 
got a trap on nomination*

*i dont know motherf***** man thats a thousand in dongs/ 
 thousand dollar cashews widows ya/
 you a lot/
 fools are the from atlanta*

Overall, the results don't seem exactly like a real trap song in the least (nor do they seem to make any sense), which goes to show that trap music isn't really as formulaic as the music critics complain about. This certainly was a fun side project, but I think the overall model could have definitely been improved with:
1. More money (any one know how to dispute a $300 AWS charge??). But no joke, an AWS EC2 instance with a GPU is expensive, and limited the number of model architectures I could test.
2. A character-based RNN model over the word-level model I used in this example. I thought the word level word2vec input would allow the model to have more context for the songs it was generating, but I think having a 30,000+ word vocabulary size vs a 26+ character vocabulary size made it *much* more difficult to train.
3. More data. Although 500,000 sequences as input *seems* like a lot of data, I'm not sure it was enough for the model to learn. Think about it; the model has to learn english syntax, grammar, and the nuances of lyrics *from scratch*, so the size of data was actually fairly limited to learn all of this information. Of course, with a character-level model, there would be much more data, since splitting up lyrics into 10 character sequences provides much more sample data to learn from, but with the added complication of learning spelling.

If you’d like to view the full code, you can check it out on my github repository [here](https://github.com/frankiezeager/trap_generator). You can also try generating your own lyrics by using my Heroku app located [here](http://trap-generator.zeager.xyz).
